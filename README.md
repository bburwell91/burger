# Eat-DA-Burger!

This is an app that logs data with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and Sequelize, and follows the MVC design pattern.

How the app functions:
- Enter the name of the burger you would like to order
- The burger is added to the database and loads on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured
- Click the button with the name of your burger to send it to the right side of the page in the devoured column
- This updates the database, you can add as many burgers as you like so please enjoy!
